# Profile Mockup

## Setup/Installation

To get this project running, you will first need to clone the Git repository
into a local folder on your machine. Once it is cloned, open a terminal
window, navigate to the project, and run:

```
npm install
```

This will download the necessary packages for the project to work as intended.
This project uses Expo, a tool to develop and build mobile applications across
multiple platforms easily. To run the project, you will also have to download
expo-cli, the command line interface for Expo projects. To install this,
run:

```
npm install --global expo-cli
```

Then, to run the project locally, you will have to run:

```
npm start
```

which should open a browser window on http://localhost:19002/. From here,
you can choose to run on an iOS simulator, which will open the Simulator
Application on MacOS. To view this project
on a physical mobile device, you can install the Expo Go Application,
and scan the QRcode that appears once the site is running locally. For
this to work correctly, the mobile device must be connected to the same
wireless network as the computer running the application.

## Run without Installation

Alternatively, if you would like to check out this mobile app without
downloading the project, you can visit https://expo.dev/@mfgallagher/ProfileApp,
and scan the QRcode with the camera of a mobile device. For this, you will need
the Expo Go mobile application.
