# Profile Mockup

## Setup/Installation

To get this project running, you will first need to clone the Git repository
into a local folder on your machine. Once it is cloned, open a terminal
window, navigate to the project, and run:

```
npm install
```

This will download the necessary packages for the project to work as intended.
To run the project locally, you will have to run:

```
npm start
```

which should open a browser window on http://localhost:19002/. From here,
you can choose to run on an iOS simulator, which will open the Simulator
Application on MacOS. This project uses Expo, a tool to develop and build
mobile applications across multiple platforms easily.
